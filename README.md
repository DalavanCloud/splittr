Splittr
=======

**Splittr** is a CSS3 and JavaScript library that implements a GUI splitter.

**Splittr** does not depend on any other libraries (no jQuery)!

## Usage

In your HTML, use the `data-split` attribute.

**Important:** The object containing the `data-split` attribute *must* have a defined `width` and `height`, and it must be `position: relative`, `position: absolute`, or `position: fixed`.  All child elements will become `position: absolute`.
